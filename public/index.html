                                Joshua deLorimier is a new media artist, 
                            software developer and interactive motion graphics designer. 
                            Due to his passion for the real-time integration of sound 
                            and music, Joshua has crafted a career around the design of 
                            audio reactive visuals and artwork for live stage concert 
                            situations. Joshua has designed and performed visuals with 
                            acclaimed musicians spanning multiple genres. He creates 
                            custom software designs with mathematical algorithms to 
                            produce immersive interactive experiences with the 
                            accompanying music. He is trained formally in motion 
                            graphics and film editing from Wilmington University in 
                            Wilmington, DE and Video Symphony in Burbank, CA.
                            Joshua works fluently with 3D packages and 2D design tools.
                            He builds custom modified software designed specifically to
                            handle his unique and meticulous workflow. 
                            Joshua believes that the tools used in the production 
                            of creative work are as influential to the process as 
                            the artist themselves. In the last year, he has expanded 
                            his portfolio with numerous works including an installation 
                            entitled “Algorithmic Structures” which was displayed at a local
                            venue in Newark, Delaware. Joshua has recently begun working on
                            mobile platforms and is currently concentrating on developing 
                            virtual reality software.
